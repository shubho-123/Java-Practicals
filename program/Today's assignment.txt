Q.
Read the question carefully and follow the input and output format.

Given an integer array. The first index represents the Student id, Second index represents C-programming marks and the third index Represents SQL marks. 
Write a program to find the Ids of students who have cleared both C-programming and SQL.

Note :(1) The Pass Marks is >=70

Input and Output Format :

First line of input consists of n, the number of elements. Next n lines correspond to the array elements. Output consist of an integer array.

1) Print "Invalid array size" when size of the array is negative and terminate the program.
2) Print "Invalid input" when there is any negative number available in the input array and terminate the program.

Include a function named clearedStage1(int array[], int size) whose return type is void.
The output array is stored in a instance variable named cleared.
