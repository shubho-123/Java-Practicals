132.What is difference between Collection and Stream?

     Stream: ues for execution purpose it is easy, execution fast for large data also, parallal execution,we can perform multiple operation at a time.
133.What is difference between intermediate and terminal operation in stream?
ans. 1>intermediate operations are lazy in nature and do not execute immediately, Terminal operations are not lazy and they executed as soon as encountered.
     2>All intermediate operations returns stream as it just transform stream into another, terminal operation don't.
     3>filter() is an intermediate operation, 
	count() is terminal operation

135.Why constructor overriding is not possible?
136.is default keyword one of the access-modifier?
ans. no, see ex. in instance variable.//int n; we are not specifing acces modifier but it is default
	but you use default in Interface as default methods
137.What is Different between protected and default?
ans. see chat in notes.
