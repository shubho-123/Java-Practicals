2.Student : id,name,m1,m2,m3,total, percent. create both constructor and appropriate method.	         	##Done

	
3.	create a class Employee with the following data members and member functions.							##Done
	Data members : empName,empCode, basicSalary, allowance, grossSalary, tax, netSalary
	Member Functions :
	void accept() : to input empName, empCode, basicSalary
	void allow() : to calc and store allowance as 55% of basicSalary.  
	void gross() : to calc and store grossSalary as sum of basicSalary and allowance
	void tax() : to calc and store tax as 12% of grossSalary
	void net() : to calc and store netSalary as grossSalary less tax.
	void display() : to display salary slip containing empCode, empName, basicSalary, tax and netSalary
	void main() : create an object of a class and execute all methods in logical order.
	constructor : to declare all the data members to zero/nil
	
	
4.	create a class called Best with the following data members and member functions.							##Done
	Data members : custName,phoneNo,number of calls, tax and bill.
	Member Functions :
	accept() : input custName, phoneNo and calls from user
	billing() : calc bill amount based on the following condition
	
		Number of calls			Rate per call(Rs)
		up to 100				nill
		next 200				0.80
		next 200				1.25
		above 500				2.50
		
		The program should add 12% service tax over the bill amount to get the final bill.
		
		
		
		
		
5.Q.
Read the question carefully and follow the input and output format.

In a game show everybody got one coupon with some code. They need to generate a code with only even numbers in that coupon. Find the answer.

Input and Output Format :
Input consists of  an integer. Output consist of an integer, which is the generated code.

1) Print "Number too small" when the given input number is a negative number.
2) Print "Number too large" when the given input number is greater than 32767.
3) Print 0 If the coupon does not contain any even numbers.

Include a function named generateCode(int coupon) whose return type is an integer, which is the generated code.

Sample Input 1:
4352

Sample Output 1:
42

Sample Input 2:
1357

Sample Output 2:
0

Sample Input 3:
-1357

Sample Output 3:
Number too small


6.Read the question carefully and follow the input and output format.

Given the cubic capacity(CC) of a bike. Write a function to return the mileage/liter for the given Cubic Capacity(CC). The mileage will be calculated as follows:

if CC is between 100 and 125, mileage is 75
if CC is between 126 and 135, mileage is 70
if CC is between 136 and 150, mileage is 60
if CC is between 151 and 200, mileage is 50
if CC is between 201 and 220, mileage is 35

First line of input consists of an integer that corresponds to CC of a bike. Output consist of an integer, which is the mileage.

Print "Number too large" when the given input CC is greater than 220.
Print "Number too small" when the given input CC is less than 100.

Include a function named findMileage(int cc) whose return type is an integer, which is the mileage.

Sample Input 1:
1

Sample Output 1:
Number too small

Sample Input 2:
160

Sample Output 2:
50
